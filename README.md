# MyWorld
MyWorld is a roleplay based plugin for Bukkit. It contains tons of features, including my own world generation from NASA and OpenStreetMap data. It was developed for roughly 1.5 years by me.

# Server
MyWorld is intended to be used with Minecraft Bukkit 1.7.10.
You might have to change the class https://github.com/AntonioNoack/MyWorld/blob/master/me/corperateraider/generator/Generator.java, because it was written specifically for 1.7.10 to speed up the setting of blocks.

# Main Things
Those happen in me/corperateraider.
CorperateRaider is one of my names on the web.
CorperRaider, because CorperateRaider is too long, is my name at UPlay.
