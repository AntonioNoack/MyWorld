# MyWorld
MyWorld is a roleplay based plugin for Bukkit. It contains tons of features, including my own world generation from NASA and OpenStreetMap data. It was developed for roughly 1.5 years by me.

# Main Things
To play the map, download https://www.mediafire.com/file/4kmua5vd0pr1nw8/MyWorld.zip/file, there everything is included (I tested it).
Get started by loggin in, playing the tutorial riddle (#/yourgrace), and enjoying the world!
You can become king by paying 81 gold to the @king.

The most interesting stuff happens in me/corperateraider.
AntiCheat was included back then, but often haved badly, so I removed it. I can ofc be reactivated.

# Map
If you are lost on the map, just look up Jena, Germany on Google Maps or OpenStreetMaps. It's based on that, all streets are the same!
