# MyWorld
MyWorld is a roleplay based plugin for Bukkit. It contains tons of features, including my own world generation from NASA and OpenStreetMap data. It was developed for roughly 1.5 years by me.

# Main Things
To play the map, download https://www.mediafire.com/file/4kmua5vd0pr1nw8/MyWorld.zip/file, there everything is included (I tested it).
Get started by loggin in, playing the tutorial riddle (#/yourgrace), and enjoying the world!
You can become king by paying 81 gold to the @king.

The most interesting stuff happens in me/corperateraider.
AntiCheat was included back then, but often behaved badly, so I removed it. It can ofc be reactivated.

# Map
If you are lost on the map, just look up Jena, Germany on Google Maps or OpenStreetMaps. It's based on that, all streets are the same! https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jena/@50.9288487,11.5845936,265m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a6a8b94f0a2f59:0x4208ec174333620!8m2!3d50.927054!4d11.5892372, the JenTower (large tower in the center) is the same as the bank, golden tower at 0,120,0 in the game, which will fill up with the funds of the king!
